For my first milestone project I wanted to create a website of one of my hobbies.
I like to travel around the world and take pictures.
These pictures I wanted to show to you and how beautifull nature and wildlife can be!
I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.

## UX
 
#### User Stories
- Click on the picture link brings up an dropdown menu.

- Select and click South Africa from the dropdown list to go see the pictures.

- Select and click on Costa Rica from the dropdown list to go see the pictures.

- Select and click on Namibia from the dropdown list to go see the pictures.

#### Design

On this website I wanted to be clear what it is all about and what I do.
I used a jumbtron with a picture of myself taking a picture with my camera.
The text inside the jumbtron shows my name and what I do.

Under the jumbtron I wanted to make it more personal and added a quote of myself.
Three big pictures are beneath the quote of each trip I been on with a click here link.

All the pictures in South Africa, Costa Rica and Namibia I took myself with a Canon camera.

On mobile devices i used an hamburger icon for easy navigation.
